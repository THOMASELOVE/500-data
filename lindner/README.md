# The `lindner` example

The `lindner` data come from an observational study of 996 patients receiving an initial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) at Ohio Heart Health, Christ Hospital, Cincinnati in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the Lindner Center. The patients thought to be more severely diseased were assigned to treatment with abciximab (an expensive, high-molecular-weight IIb/IIIa cascade blocker); in fact, only 298 (29.9 percent) of patients received usual-care-alone with their initial PCI. The `lindner` data is part of the `twang` package, and we have also made it available in the `data` folder on this page.

The analysis provided here was developed by **Wyatt Bensken** and **Harry Persaud**. It involves 12 separate tasks using methods for both quantitative and binary outcomes that are analogous to those in the `toy` example developed by Professor Love. 

We hope you find this helpful.
