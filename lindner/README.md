# The `lindner` example

Last Update: 2023-02-08

The entire example can be downloaded from the front page of the 500-data website.

Here is the [Quarto file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/blob/master/lindner/lindner.qmd) including all code.

I've also placed an [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/lindner-500) at https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/lindner-500, and you can download the Quarto file from there, too (just click on the CODE box on the top right of the screen and select View Source.)

## The `lindner` data

The `lindner` data come from an observational study of 996 patients receiving an initial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) at Ohio Heart Health, Christ Hospital, Cincinnati in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the Lindner Center. The patients thought to be more severely diseased were assigned to treatment with abciximab (an expensive, high-molecular-weight IIb/IIIa cascade blocker); in fact, only 298 (29.9 percent) of patients received usual-care-alone with their initial PCI. The `lindner` data is part of the `twang` package, and we have also made it available in the `data` folder on this page.

The analysis provided here was developed by **Wyatt P. Bensken** and **Harry Persaud**. It involves 12 separate tasks using methods for both quantitative and binary outcomes that are analogous to those in the `toy` example developed by Professor Love. The main difference is in style, and in the fact that 1:1 matching without replacement performs very poorly.

We hope you find this helpful.
